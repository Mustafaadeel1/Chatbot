# Mustafa's Chatbot ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to **Mustafa's Chatbot**! This is a simple chatbot built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flask** for the backend. The chatbot features a welcoming message and allows users to interact with it. This README will guide you through how the project is structured, how to set it up, and how it works.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: The user can type messages, which are displayed in the chatbox.
- **Welcome Message**: A personalized welcome message appears when the page loads.
- **Chatbot Response**: The bot responds with a predefined message after each user input.
- **Customizable Backend**: The backend can be extended to integrate an AI model (like Google Gemini) for dynamic responses.
- **Minimalist UI**: Simple, clean, and easy-to-use interface with dark theme styling.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: Used for the structure of the chatbot page.
  - **CSS**: Used for styling the page and the chat interface.
  - **JavaScript**: Handles user input, sends messages to the backend, and displays the chatbot's response.
  
- **Backend** (Optional):
  - **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to handle the chatbot's backend logic.
  - **Google Gemini API**: The backend can be extended to integrate Google's generative AI model (Gemini) for dynamic responses.

## Folder Structure

Here is a breakdown of the project folder structure:

/chatbot-project â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Flask backend to handle chat interactions â”œâ”€â”€ templates â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.html # The HTML page for the chatbot interface â”œâ”€â”€ static â”‚ â””â”€â”€ style.css # CSS file for styling the chatbot â”œâ”€â”€ .env # Environment file to store your API key securely â””â”€â”€ README.md # This README file


## How It Works

1. **Page Load**:
   - When the page loads, a welcome message appears from the bot, greeting the user with a smiley face.

2. **User Input**:
   - The user types a message in the input field and clicks the "Send" button.
   - The message is displayed in the chatbox under the user's name.

3. **Bot Response**:
   - After the user sends a message, the chatbot responds with a predefined message: "I'm here to help you!".
   - In the future, this response can be replaced by a dynamic AI-powered message by integrating an API like Google Gemini.

4. **Styling**:
   - The page uses a **black background** and **dark-themed chat interface** for better visibility and contrast.
   - **CSS** is used to style the chat window, user messages, and bot responses with different colors.

5. **Backend (Optional)**:
   - The backend (`app.py`) handles requests from the frontend.
   - A simple API (`/chat`) receives the userâ€™s message, processes it, and responds with a predefined or dynamically generated message.

## API Key Setup (For Google Gemini Integration)

To integrate the **Google Gemini API** for dynamic responses, you will need an API key. Follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for the Google Gemini API**:
   - Go to [Google Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/genai) and sign up to get an API key.

2. **Store the API Key**:
   - Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project folder.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key:
   
   ```text
   GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
3. Backend Integration:
* In app.py, the API key is loaded from the . env file using the dotenv package.
* The backend will use this API key to interact with the Google Gemini model.
## How to Run Locally
* To run this project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

* ### Clone the repository:

1. Copy the repository link from GitHub and clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
```
2. Install dependencies:

* Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd chatbot-project
```
* If you haven't already installed the necessary Python dependencies, create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
bash

`Copy code`
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up the API key:

* Make sure you have added your API key to the .env file as explained earlier.
4. Run the Flask app:

* Start the Flask backend by running the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
5. Access the chatbot:

* Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the chatbot.
